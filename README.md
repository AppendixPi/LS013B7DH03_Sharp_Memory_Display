# LS013B7DH03_Sharp_Memory_Display
C library for LS013B7DH03 Sharp Memory Display

For the schematics I followed the manufacturer's recommendations.
Below is a screenshot of the wiring diagram.

**SCLK**     => SPI serial clock <br />
**SI**       => MOSI  <br />
**CSC**      => Chip select line <br />
**EXTCOMIN** => External clock source pin <br />
**DISP**     => Display Enable <br />
**EXTMODE**  => Clock mode selection pin <br />

In this library I use [EXTMODE = H] for external clock selection. The EXTCOMIN is connected to a 50Hz 50% PWM signal generated by microcontroller.
